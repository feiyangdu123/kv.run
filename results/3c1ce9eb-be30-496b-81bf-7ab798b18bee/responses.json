It is made up of two parts: the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity.\n\nThe special theory of relativity, published in 1905, tells us that the laws of physics are the same for all observers moving at constant speeds relative to each other. It also shows that the speed of light is always the same, no matter how fast an observer is moving or the direction they are traveling. This leads to some strange results, like time traveling and objects becoming",
