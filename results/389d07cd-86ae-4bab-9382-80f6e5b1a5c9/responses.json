The theory of relativity comes in two parts: general relativity and special relativity.\n\nSpecial relativity is the simpler of the two theories. It explains that the laws of physics are the same for everyone, no matter how fast they are moving or in which direction. It also says that time and space are not absolute, but are relative to the observer. This means that time can seem to go slower for someone who is moving fast, and distances can",
